TODO:

- ✅ Setup WebdriverIO
- ✅ Improve developer experience (watch mode with storybook)
- ✅ Setup @testing-library/webdriverio
- Figure out how to organize e2e tests
- Setup CI/CD for e2e tests
- ✅ Figure out a way for skipping tests which uses keyboard assertions (e.g. tab, enter, etc.) in mobile devices (since those tests will fail)
  - Ans: We can use driver.isMobile to skip those tests
